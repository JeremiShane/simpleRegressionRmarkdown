## R Markdown

This is a R Markdown file with a simple regression model using air quality data.

First, we are going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Now, to make a pairs plot to explore the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

```{r}
plot(fit)
```
